## API Module
 Welcome to the API Module of ProductLab. Last week you learned about data storage and manipulation. This week you'll learn how to access that data via API. You'll start by getting familiar with Postman, a powerful development tool. Then you'll use your new postman skills to experiment with REST and graphQL APIs. Finally, as a challenge we encourage you to try build your own APIs! 

 ## Housekeeping
 Please watch this repo by selecting the "watch" button, which is directly above the bright green "Code" button. This will help us keep track of participation.

 Your projects this week will be on Udemy, Strapi and other sites. To keep a central record of your accomplishments you will need to create a repository called 'Data_Module_yourname' and then upload each project to the repository. This will allow your instructors to easily review your work! Your final project will also link to this repo to demonstrate your Data skillset. 

 This repo will serve as both your solution files as well as the rubric for how you should name and structure your files. 

 ## Assignments: Academic 
 Before working on the hands on material please review the following: 

1. [An introduction into APIs for Product Managers](https://medium.com/swlh/a-product-managers-guide-to-apis-c5fffff0e5e0) 

2. [How to think through competing priorities in relation to APIs](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/demystifying-apis-product-managers-erin-howell/)
    * The begining of this article will repeat lots of what you covered in the previous article. Feel free to skim until you reach the section "What should Product Managers be thinking about when prioritising an API on their product roadmap?"

3. [A quick introduction to Swagger](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/what-is-swagger/)
    * You'll learn more about Swagger during your hands on assignments but this is a good place to start

4. [API Management](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-api-management#:~:text=API%20management%20is%20the%20process,cloud%2C%20or%20a%20hybrid%20environment.%20https://blog.hubspot.com/website/api-management)
    * This is directly relevant to your role as a PM so pay attention! 
    * [Also, in case you're curious, here is an example of an API Management platform called MuleSoft.](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/enterprise-integration)

5. [Asynchronouse code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Introducing)
    * This article is specific to JavaScript but the concepts you'll learn around asynchronous code are relevant in most languages. 
    * [Here are some best practices from experts in the industry](https://stackify.com/when-to-use-asynchronous-programming/)


## Assignments: Hands On
Enough reading! Time to make some stuff! 
1. Create a new repository in your Github called "API_Module_yourname"
    * This is where you will store your work for the module. 

2. [REST APIs with Postman for Absolute Beginners](https://eylearning.udemy.com/course/api-with-postman-for-absolute-beginners/learn/lecture/18670210#overview) 
    * This is an awesome Udemy course, please take advantage of it!
    * Assigned sections: All
    * **Required work to be uploaded to your github repository:** 
        1. Assignment: DELETE
            * upload a screenshot of your successful DELETE request on Postman. The filename in your repo should be "DELETE_postman_screenshot_yourname"
        2. Assignment: giph upload
            * upload a screenshot of the address of your giph upload. The filename in your repo should be "giph_postman_screenshot_yourname"

3. Now its time to build your own APIs and databases. There are one of two options you can choose. 
    * Option 1: [Build and query your own non-relational database](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/quick-start#_1-install-strapi-and-create-a-new-project)
        * Once you complete setting up your Strapi db experiment with some REST API queries. Review the possible queries [here](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest)
        * **Required work to be uploaded to your github repository:** 
            * The entire file structure of the Strapi DB you have built 
            * Screenshots of queries you made to your DB in Postman (include at least one example of GET, POST and DELETE)

    * Challenge Option: [Build a full stack GraphQL solution](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/)
        * This tutorial will walk you through how to setup graphQL APIs by building your own server. You'll also have the opportunity to spin up a database and connect it to your server. If you'd like you can also enhance your server to have authentication functionality and advanced queries. However, if you pick this option you only need to get through the "Connecting the Server and Database with Prisma Client" section
        * Before you dive in you may want to review [this material](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/0-introduction/) only go until the "Big Picture (Architecture) section. Its not required but will give context you may find helpful during the project
        * **Required work to be uploaded to your github repository:**
            * The entire file structure of your GraphQL project, inclusive of the server and database files

## Assignments: Challenge
If you have additional time or you want to come back to later to enhance your final project, feel free to tackle this challenge project! 

1. [An introduction to building with MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/)
    * You worked with relational databases while learning SQL. Now you have the opportunity to build and query a non-relational database. This project is doable and will help you understand what a developer experiences when working with non-relational databases like MongoDB. 

## Assignment Format 
At the end of the week we expect your Github repo to have the following files: 

1. store_db_yourname.sql
2. data_dig_yourname.sql 
3. famous_people_yourname.sql
4. library_data_model_yourname.pdf/doc
    * the file type for this project does not matter, use whatever you prefer 

## Troubleshooting
